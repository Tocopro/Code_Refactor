 The heading are arranged sequentially both in HTML and CSS and named appropriately. This will allow the code reviewer to follow the webpage code sequentially if there is any need to review or correct some elements.
 The title elements are precisely labeled and un edited. The webpage if reviewed and corrected, should have the same web content as the original page. The tags labelled in a way to allow the code reader to follow the webpage correctly. The title meaning is meant to give the webpage reader access to the meaning of the content under the header.
 When the code was refactored there were several changes that were made in naming the tags and the number of tags connected to the styling component in css. I included styling tags in css for each element in the HTML so as to enable future code reviewers to refactor each element independently.
 The comments are included in every section as a guide to the construction of the webpage and explaining the layout of 
 the code particularly between html and css.
